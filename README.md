## Welcome to AttendTracks

AttendTracks is a very simple native PHP web application for attendance tracking. 

### What does it do?

Basically, you can add new user then mark if the user is present or absent.
In specifics, it has:

* Native MVC Concept
* Foundation Styles
* Cute Raleway Font  :heart_eyes:
* Facebook-inspired theme

### Why did you made it?

Actually, it's for the sole purpose of practicing of the concept of OOP and MVC in a native way.
I always tend to solve things through front-end that I tend to forget about back-end.  :sob:
